Q3) Three Coins are tossed, find the probability that two heads and one tail are obtained?
Ans:
Heads = H, Tails = T
Possible outcomes: (H,H,H), (T,T,T), (H,H,T),(T,T,H),(H,T,T),(T,H,H),(T,H,T),(H,T,H)
Probability for two heads and one tail is: 3
i.e., (H,H,T),(T,H,H),(H,T,H)
Total outcome=Number of outcomes/Total no of outcomes
	              = 3/8

Answer: a) Equal to 1 =0
              b) Less than or equal to 4 = 1/6
              c ) Sum is divisible by 2 and 3 = 1/6 

###Q5)  A bag contains 2 red, 3 green and 2 blue balls. Two balls are drawn at random. What is the probability that none of the balls drawn is blue?###




Q6) Calculate the Expected number of candies for a randomly selected child 
Below are the probabilities of count of candies for children (ignoring the nature of the child-Generalized view)
CHILD	Candies count	Probability
A	1	0.015
B	4	0.20
C	3	0.65
D	5	0.005
E	6	0.01
F	2	0.120
Child A – probability of having 1 candy = 0.015.
Child B – probability of having 4 candies = 0.20
Solution:
Expected value = ∑x.p(x)
		     = 1*0.015+4*0.20+3*0.65+5*0.005+6*0.01+2*0.120
                          = 3.09

Q8) Calculate Expected Value for the problem below
a)	The weights (X) of patients at a clinic (in pounds), are
108, 110, 123, 134, 135, 145, 167, 187, 199
Assume one of the patients is chosen at random. What is the Expected Value of the Weight of that patient?
Sol:  Expected value   : ∑p(x)E(x)
         Probability of selecting each patient =1/9
         Expected value : 108, 110,123,134,135,145,167,187,199
         Probability of x : 1/9, 1/9,1/9,1/9,1/9,1/9,1/6,1/9,1/9
         Expected value = 1/9(108+110+123+134+135+145+167+187+199)
			   = 1/9(1308)

Q11)  Suppose we want to estimate the average weight of an adult male in    Mexico. We draw a random sample of 2,000 men from a population of 3,000,000 men and weigh them. We find that the average person in our sample weighs 200 pounds, and the standard deviation of the sample is 30 pounds. Calculate 94%,98%,96% confidence interval?
Solution:
import numpy as np

(198.43943840429978, 201.56056159570022)
# Avg. weight of Adult in Mexico with 96% CI
stats.norm.interval(0.96,200,30/(2000**0.5))
(198.62230334813333, 201.37769665186667)
