1.	The time required for servicing transmissions is normally distributed with µ= = 45 minutes and  = 8 minutes. The service manager plans to have work begin on the transmission of a customer’s car 10 minutes after the car is dropped off and the customer is told that the car will be ready within 1 hour from drop-off. What is the probability that the service manager cannot meet his commitment? 

A.	0.3875   
B.	0.2676   
C.	0.5   
D.	0.6987 
Answer: given µ=45,  = 8 
He starting the work 10min after the car is dropped and then µ become 55
Then normal distribution z=( x- µ)/
from scipy import stats
stats.norm.cdf(60,55,8) # for meeting the commitment
1-stats.norm.cdf(60,55,8) # for not meeting
0.26598552904870054
So, answer is B


2.	The current age (in years) of 400 clerical employees at an insurance claims processing center is normally distributed with mean  = 38 and Standard deviation  =6. For each statement below, please specify True/False. If false, briefly explain why.
A.	More employees at the processing center are older than 44 than between 38 and 44.
Answer: from scipy import stats
                 1-stats.norm.cdf(44, 38,6)
       0.15865525393145707
       stats.norm.cdf(44,38,6)- stats.norm.cdf(38,38,6)
       0.3413447460685429
              statement A is False as Probability of employees aged between 38 to 44 is more.

B.	A training program for employees under the age of 30 at the center would be expected to attract about 36 employees.
Answer:
# No. of employees attending training program from 400 nos. is N*P(X<30)
400*stats.norm.cdf(30,38,6)
36.484487890347154


3.	If X1 ~ N(μ, σ2) and X2 ~ N(μ, σ2) are iid normal random variables, then what is the difference between 2 X1 and X1 + X2? Discuss both their distributions and parameters.       
Answer:  
X ∼ N(µ1, σ1^2 ), and  Y ∼ N(µ2, σ2^2 ) are two independent  random variables 
then   X + Y ∼ N(µ1 + µ2, σ1^2 + σ2^2 ) , and      X − Y ∼ N(µ1 − µ2, σ1^2 + σ2^2 )
2X1~ N(2 u,4 σ^2) and X1+X2 ~  N(µ + µ, σ^2 + σ^2 ) ~ N(2 u, 2σ^2 )
2X1-(X1+X2) = N ( 4µ,6 σ^2)


4.	Let X ~ N (100, 202). Find two values, a and b, symmetric about the mean, such that the probability of the random variable taking a value between them is 0.99. 

A.	90.5, 105.9 
B.	80.2, 119.8 
C.	22, 78 
D.	48.5, 151.5 
E.	90.1, 109.9

Ans. Since we need to find out the values of a and b, which are symmetric about the mean, such that the probability of random variable taking a value between them is 0.99, we have to work out in reverse order. 
The Probability of getting value between a and b should be 0.99.
So the Probability of going wrong, or the Probability outside the a and b area is 0.01 (ie. 1-0.99).
The Probability towards left from a = -0.005 (ie. 0.01/2). 
The Probability towards right from b = +0.005 (ie. 0.01/2).
So since we have the probabilities of a and b, we need to calculate X, the random variable at a and b which has got these probabilities. 
By finding the Standard Normal Variable Z (Z Value), we can calculate the X values.
Z=(X- μ) / σ 
For Probability 0.005 the Z Value is -2.57 (from Z Table).
Z * σ + μ = X
Z(-0.005)*20+100 = -(-2.57)*20+100 = 151.4
Z(+0.005)*20+100 = (-2.57)*20+100 = 48.6
So, option D is correct.

5.	Consider a company that has two different divisions. The annual profits from the two divisions are independent and have distributions Profit1 ~ N(5, 32) and Profit2 ~ N(7, 42) respectively. Both the profits are in $ Million. Answer the following questions about the total profit of the company in Rupees. Assume that $1 = Rs. 45
A.	Specify a Rupee range (centered on the mean) such that it contains 95% probability for the annual profit of the company.
B.	Specify the 5th percentile of profit (in Rupees) for the company
C.	Which of the two divisions has a larger probability of making a loss in a given year?

Answer: 
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats
from scipy.stats import norm
# Mean profits from two different divisions of a company = Mean1 + Mean2
Mean = 5+7
print('Mean Profit is Rs', Mean*45,'Million')
Mean Profit is Rs 540 Million
# Variance of profits from two different divisions of a company = SD^2 = SD1^2 + SD2^2
SD = np.sqrt((9)+(16))
print('Standard Deviation is Rs', SD*45, 'Million')
Standard Deviation is Rs 225.0 Million
# A. Specify a Rupee range (centered on the mean) such that it contains 95% probability for the annual profit of the company.
print('Range is Rs',(stats.norm.interval(0.95,540,225)),'in Millions')
Range is Rs (99.00810347848784, 980.9918965215122) in Millions
# B. Specify the 5th percentile of profit (in Rupees) for the company
# To compute 5th Percentile, we use the formula X=μ + Zσ; wherein from z table, 5 percentile = -1.645
X= 540+(-1.645)*(225)
print('5th percentile of profit (in Million Rupees) is',np.round(X,))
5th percentile of profit (in Million Rupees) is 170.0
# C. Which of the two divisions has a larger probability of making a loss in a given year?
# Probability of Division 1 making a loss P(X<0)
stats.norm.cdf(0,5,3)
0.0477903522728147
# Probability of Division 2 making a loss P(X<0)
stats.norm.cdf(0,7,4)
0.040059156863817086
