2. Answer the following three questions based on the box-plot above.
(i)	What is inter-quartile range of this dataset? (please approximate the numbers) In one line, explain what this value implies.
Answer: Inner quartile range is the difference between third quartile and first quartile
IQR: Q3-Q1
Q1=5
Q3=12(approximately)
IQR= Q3-Q1
       = 12-5
       =7
Q1 represents lower quartile 
Q3 represents upper quartile
And this contain one outlier which is on 25. 
ii)	What can we say about the skewness of this dataset?
Answer:  In the boxplot, the vertical line in the boxplot represents the median is much closer to the first quartile than the third quartile, which means distribution is right skewed 

iii)	If it was found that the data point with the value 25 is actually 2.5, how would the new box-plot be affected?
Answer: the point in the 25 is an outlier

3.
Answer the following three questions based on the histogram above.
(i)	Where would the mode of this dataset lie?
Answer:  Near 4 to 8 represent the mode of the dataset
(ii)	Comment on the skewness of the dataset.
Answer: In histogram the data is distributed near left side and long tail in the right side and this distribution is called as right skewed	
(iii)	Suppose that the above histogram and the box-plot in question 2 are plotted for the same dataset. Explain how these graphs complement each other in providing information about any dataset. 
Answer: Both boxplot and histogram have the right skewed. Boxplot is used for identifying the outliers. And histogram is used to find the probability distribution.

4.	AT&T was running commercials in 1990 aimed at luring back customers who had switched to one of the other long-distance phone service providers. One such commercial shows a businessman trying to reach Phoenix and mistakenly getting Fiji, where a half-naked native on a beach responds incomprehensibly in Polynesian. When asked about this advertisement, AT&T admitted that the portrayed incident did not actually take place but added that this was an enactment of something that “could happen.” Suppose that one in 200 long-distance telephone calls is misdirected. What is the probability that at least one in five attempted telephone calls reaches the wrong number? (Assume independence of attempts.)
Answer: 
E be the event
E: the call is misdirected
The probability of an event is P(E) = 1/200
The probability of not occurring an event P(E)=1-P[E]
                                              =1-1/200=199/200
Probability that at least one in five attempted call reaches the wrong number is 
                                                           = 1-(199/200*199/200*199/200*199/200*199/200)
                                                           =0.025
                                                           
5.	Returns on a certain business venture, to the nearest $1,000, are known to follow the following probability distribution
x	P(x)
-2,000	0.1
-1,000	0.1
0	0.2
1000	0.2
2000	0.3
3000	0.1

(i)	What is the most likely monetary outcome of the business venture?
Answer:  the most likely monetary outcome of the business venture x=2000, with the highest probability of 0.3
(ii)	Is the venture likely to be successful? Explain
Answer: it is successful because p(x=1000 )+p(x=2000)+p(x=3000) = 0.2+0.3+0.1 = 0.6, more than 50% 
(iii)	What is the long-term average earning of business ventures of this kind? Explain
Answer:  the long-term average earning of business ventures of this kind are “Expected value” are average of probability distribution.
(-2000)(0.1)+(-1000)(0.1)+0(0.2)+(1000)(0.2)+(2000)(0.3)+(3000)(0.1) = 800
iv)          What is the good measure of the risk involved in a venture of this kind? Compute this measure
Answer: good measure of risk involved in a venture of this kind is calculated using variance. Because it squares the positive and negative deviations
